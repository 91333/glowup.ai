✨ GlowUp.ai: Personalized Skincare & Haircare Recommender ✨
GlowUp.ai is an AI-powered web application designed to provide personalized skincare and haircare routines, product type recommendations, and holistic wellness advice based on individual needs.

Features:
Personalized Routines: Get tailored skincare or haircare routines (cleansers, serums, shampoos, masks, etc.) based on your specific skin/hair type and concerns.
AI-Powered Analysis: Receive an intelligent analysis of your skin or hair condition.
Dietary & Lifestyle Advice: Discover foods to eat and avoid, general diet recommendations, natural remedies, and general beauty tips for a healthier glow from within.
Routine Refinement: Troubleshoot issues or ask follow-up questions about your recommended routine to get refined, actionable advice.
Image Analysis (Optional): Upload a photo for enhanced AI analysis of your skin's visible aspects.
Rotating Beauty Quotes: Enjoy inspiring beauty quotes on the welcome page.

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS): For structured, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing UI.
JavaScript: For dynamic interactivity and client-side logic.
Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash): Powers the core AI recommendation, analysis, and troubleshooting functionalities.
Firebase (Auth): For anonymous and custom token authentication to manage user sessions (though not for persistent data storage in this version).

How it Works:
Users provide details about their skin or hair type, specific concerns, and any preferences. The application then leverages the Google Gemini API to generate a comprehensive, multi-faceted personalized plan, including product type suggestions (without specific brands), dietary advice, natural remedies, and general tips. A dedicated section allows for further refinement and troubleshooting of the suggested routines.
